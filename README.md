# 🎮 Python Games

This repository contains simple games built using the Pygame library in Python. These projects mark my first experience with UI-based applications and serve as practice for working with Python virtual environments and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms.

## 🕹️ Games List

### 1️⃣ Space Invaders 1.0

>[!NOTE]
> This is the first version of the Space Invaders game, created to explore the basics of the Pygame library. It introduces fundamental game mechanics such as player movement and collision detection.

### 2️⃣ Space Invaders 2.0

> [!NOTE]
> This is an improved adaptation of the Space Invaders game, designed with scalability in mind. The code follows OOP principles, making future expansions and modifications easier.
